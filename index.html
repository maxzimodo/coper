              The world today revolves around online interaction, with over 80%
              of the population utilising various online services. However,
              there's a common need that unites everyone: money. Regardless of
              religion, race, or language, everyone requires financial means for
              various purposes. Yet often, there's a crucial shortage of funds
              when needed most.
            </p>
            <p class="p gutterbottom">
              For instance, someone might need money to pay rent or buy
              groceries, while for others, it's essential capital for a startup.
              In a world where you can book a round-the-world trip from home,
              why not have a service where people can help each other in
              difficult times? That's precisely what Coper offers! After a quick
              registration, you can access micro-loans provided by other
              participants, bypassing banking checks. On the platform, both
              borrowers and lenders register for mutually beneficial
              cooperation.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
              Coper is the future of financial services, where your credit
              rating isn't as crucial as your ability to lend a hand or receive
              help when needed.

            <p class="p gutterbottom">
              Coper was created by a team of promising developers forced to
              leave Russia due to their disagreement with the war unleashed by
              the Russian government in Ukraine. Facing challenges in finding a
              new home and bureaucratic hurdles in settling elsewhere, Coper
              emerged from the collaboration and results of adapting to a new
              life beyond their homeland.
            </p>
            <p class="p gutterbottom">
              The idea behind Coper arose from adapting to life in a new
              environment, where people strive to help each other and contribute
              to society. The name "Coper" is a contraction of "Cooperation,"
              emphasizing interaction and support. Through their struggles, the
              project's creators realized that the quickest way to solve
              problems is to turn to specific individuals, friends, comrades,
              rather than abstract organizations that might put you on a waiting
              list. Only a specific person here and now can help solve an urgent
              problem quickly and without unnecessary questions.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
              The idea's author and project founder: Zakhar Ivachev. Co-founders
              of the project: Maxim Odoevsky and Vasily Konstantinovsky.

              We aim to create a platform that unites people to provide
              assistance and support in various aspects of life, especially in
              challenging times. From supporting small businesses in Africa to
              helping students pay for education, Coper assists people in
              different corners of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="p gutterbottom">
              On one hand, our service isn't just about facilitating credit
              cooperation between two specific individuals but also about
              providing assistance and support when needed. We're creating a
              service that helps small businesses, students, mothers, fathers,
              cultural and artistic figures in their hour of need, serving all
              layers of society, regardless of race, nationality, citizenship,
              or religion.
            </p>
            <p class="p gutterbottom">
              On the other hand, our service involves investors, ensuring trust.
              The program not only offers the opportunity to earn above-market
              returns but also allows individuals to feel involved in doing
              something genuinely good by providing assistance and support in
              difficult times. After all, for someone, 100 euros might be just a
              casino bet they'll lose with a 50% chance, while for someone else,
              such as a small business owner in an African country, it could be
              their weekly turnover, which could grow into something more
              significant thanks to timely investments. Project Coper is a
              cooperation platform born out of the need for help and support in
              difficult times. We bring people together, offering the
              opportunity to assist small businesses, students, families, and
              other segments of society. Our mission is to promote cooperation
              and create good deeds that benefit the entire world.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
              Transparency and safety are our priorities. We develop strict
              rules and checks to ensure safety and transparency for all project
              participants, minimizing risks and guaranteeing trust.
